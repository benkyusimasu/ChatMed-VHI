IAV is an enveloped virus that belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family [5]. On the lipid bilayer of virus particle, there are two abundant membrane proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and a few copies of matrix protein 2 (M2). Beneath the lipid membrane is matrix protein 1 (M1), which forms a shell and gives strength and rigidity to the lipid envelope. Within the core of the virion are eight segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome encoding at least 11 proteins. Each RNA segment is associated with multiple copies of nucleoproteins (NP) and a small number of heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complexes that comprise polymerase acidic (PA), polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2), which together form the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP).\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the virus whose protein interacts with host factors/proteins?\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Influenza A"}]}

On the lipid bilayer of virus particle, there are two abundant membrane proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and a few copies of matrix protein 2 (M2). Beneath the lipid membrane is matrix protein 1 (M1), which forms a shell and gives strength and rigidity to the lipid envelope. Within the core of the virion are eight segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome encoding at least 11 proteins. Each RNA segment is associated with multiple copies of nucleoproteins (NP) and a small number of heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complexes that comprise polymerase acidic (PA), polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2), which together form the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP).\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the virus whose protein interacts with host factors/proteins?\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Influenza A"}]}

It is quite possible that the overexpression of Nsp2 may change the intracellular milieu and perturb host intracellular signaling, thus interfering with the recruitment into the Nup98 compartments.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the virus protein interacting with the host protein/RBP/host factor?\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nsp2"}]}
