This study identified a strong enrichment of the CCT complex (cytosolic chaperonin-containing T complex), and subunits of the OST (oligosaccharyl transferase) complex such as DDOST, STT3A, STT3B and RPN2, in the NS1 interactome.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the host protein/RBP/host factor interacting with the virus?\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "CCT complex (cytosolic chaperonin-containing T complex), and subunits of the OST (oligosaccharyl transferase) complex such as DDOST, STT3A, STT3B and RPN2"}]}
